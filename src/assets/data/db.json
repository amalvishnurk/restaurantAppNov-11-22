Having read much, I knew going into it that it was not going to be authentic Chinese. The place was edgy, had a punk rock throwback attitude, and generally delivered the desired atmosphere. Things went downhill from there though. The food was okay at best and the best qualities were easily overshadowed by what I believe to be poor decisions by the kitchen staff."

In addition to the pies, consider ordering the radishes, the romaine salad, the roasted beets, and some of the charcuterie."

Came here for lunch on a random weekday afternoon and when we arrived, there was a line forming already. The space is a bit cramped. You'll get to know your neighbors soon enough. The pizza is just delightful and delicious. It's a ncie plus that you get to see them firing up the pizzas in the corner. The major issue with Roberta's is the trek out to the Williamsburg/Bushwick."

It has A LOT of hype in the New York food scene, and I question if it deserves all of it, but it's still a totally great spot to hit up when in the area!!"

Their pork tacos are to die for, their different variety of ribs and lastly, their lamb is not gamey at all. Super wallet friendly for the amount they give you. I highly recommend this spot- after eating here, you can definitely walk over for Steve's key lime pies."

The Dutch is now an indelible part of the Soho landscape."

The food is surprisingly well-executed and conceived, and our dinner service flowed smoothly without a hitch. Just make sure to get a reservation in advance, as I'm sure more than just a few other people will have the same idea."

Had the chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and it was really good. Great balance in flavor and a good portion. Extra tasty with their hot sauces. My wife had the lamb but it was a bit too salty for our taste. Although, it was cooked very well and fell off the bone. The highlight of the night was the tres leches cake. Probably the best I've ever had to be honest. Not too sweet and very milky. Overall, one of my top 3 favorite Mexican in NY."
